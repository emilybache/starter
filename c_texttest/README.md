Sample project
==============

This is a C empty starter project with an initial test written in TextTest. Build it with CMake then start texttest in
the same folder as this README file. There should be one test case - "hello" - which fails since there are no approved
files yet. If you see "Hello, World! Foobar is: 42" in standard output, then everything is working and you 
can approve that result. From there you should be able to build a better test for whatever it is you actually want to
build.
