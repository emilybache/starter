Sample project
==============

This is a C empty starter project. The production code in "src" is in C. **If you would like to write your production code in C++, use a different starter project.**

For test code there are several options: 

* test-catch2 - write your tests in C++ with [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) and [ApprovalTests](https://github.com/approvals/approvaltests.cpp)
* test-cmocka - write your tests in C with the [CMocka framework](https://api.cmocka.org/)
* test-gtest - write your tests in C++ with [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and [ApprovalTests](https://github.com/approvals/approvaltests.cpp)
